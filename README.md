**PLEASE NOTE:** This repo will NOT be updated anymore, meaning this is very likely not to work when elementaryOS 7 comes out. If you're reading this from the future and you're already with eOS7 or +, please consider forking or making your own approach for this.

This is a recreation of macOS window control buttons for elementaryOS 6.1. That's the only affected aspect from elementary's default theme, since I like the out-of-the-box aesthetic of the OS.

This repo specifically is a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/yarik-vv/OS-X-buttons), which had implemented it for elementaryOS Loki. All credits to the [original author](https://github.com/yarik-vv).

I also used the newer default themes' GTK found [in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/elementaryos/comments/ncey26/i_ripped_the_elementary_os_6_gtk_themes_for_use/).

## Install guide

1. Clone the repo to any folder
2. Grab the folders corresponding to the colors you'd like to install and copy them to `/home/username/.themes` (replace `username` with your actual username)
3. Install [pantheon tweaks](https://github.com/pantheon-tweaks/pantheon-tweaks)
4. Open system settings, enter to **Tweaks** and under the **Appearance** tab, click the **GTK** select and set it to `color-osx-buttons` (`color` being the color you want to use)
5. Reboot for it to apply to the entire system

## Disclaimer

This is my first time messing with GTK and Linux theming in general. Please use with that in mind.
