This is a recreation of macOS window control buttons for elementaryOS 6.1. This repo specifically is a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/yarik-vv/OS-X-buttons), which had implemented it for elementaryOS Loki.

I also used the newer default themes' GTK found [in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/elementaryos/comments/ncey26/i_ripped_the_elementary_os_6_gtk_themes_for_use/).

## Install guide

1.  Clone the repo to `/home/username/.themes`. Make sure all the files are inside a single folder
2.  Install [pantheon tweaks](https://github.com/pantheon-tweaks/pantheon-tweaks)
3.  Open system settings, enter to **Tweaks** and under the **Appearance** tab, click the **GTK** select and set it to `elementary-OS-X-buttons`
4.  In my case I also had to reboot for it to apply to the entire system

## Disclaimer

This is my first time messing with GTK and Linux theming in general. Please use with that in mind.

## TODO

-   Currently, the color theme is Lime. Should just make a separate theme/folder for each color theme.
